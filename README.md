# De-Reverberation Data Tools

##Usage
For an example of how to create a dataset and dataloader, see `Using_Dataloader.ipynb`.  
To modify the dataset/transforms, open `Reverb_Investigation.ipynb` and modify the code there for easy experimenting. Running the cells with the `%%writefile *` magics uncommented will export the code into python files for easy reuse.
