To evaluate the results, two common speech metrics are used: \ac{STOI} and \ac{PESQ}. \ac{STOI} measures speech intelligibility, whereas \ac{PESQ} measures speech quality. Figure \ref{fig:metrics} shows the scaling for each score. Both \ac{PESQ} and \ac{STOI} are intended to be used on segments of speech that are many frames long. In order to measure results in this manner, a long segment of speech is reconstructed using the \ac{WOLA} method \todo[inline]{cite if i can find this...}. This method was chosen over concatenating adjacent frames because it lessens the severity of discontinuities at frame boundaries. The \ac{WOLA} method consists of reconstructing frames that overlap by a constant number of samples. Reconstructed frames are multiplied by a Hann window. All frames are then added together with respective offsets to create the final reconstructed signal. Table \ref{tab:results} shows the mean change in the speech metric scores for 10 reconstructed random  examples from the validation set. Both the time-domain and frequency-domain networks improve the \ac{STOI} while making the \ac{PESQ} worse. These networks may be useful for tasks such as \ac{ASR} where intelligibility is valued over quality. Notably, the frequency-domain network achieved both a larger boost in \ac{STOI} and a larger detriment to the \ac{PESQ} than the time-domain network. Figure \ref{fig:specs} shows spectrograms for the input, target, and both models for an example speech sequence.
