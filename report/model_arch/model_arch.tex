\noindent The two networks used are both based on the U-Net architecture originally proposed for speech enhancement/denoising in \cite{pandey_new_2019}. The specific layer sizes and the architecture of each block is detailed in figure \ref{fig:architecture}. The time-domain network replaces the final rectified linear unit activation with a hyperbolic tangent activation to produce values between -1 and 1. The frequency domain network is one block in a larger traditional signal processing system shown in figure \ref{fig:systems}.
