In real world environments, speech is heard as a mix of direct signal with reflections caused by the surrounding environment. Late reflections decrease speech intelligibility, causing problems for listeners, as well as tasks such as \ac{ASR}. This work explores the potential of convolutional networks to remove problematic reverberation in speech signals.
