A time-domain network and a frequency-domain network, both based on the u-net architecture, have been presented to perform speech dereverberation. Both networks increase speech intelligibility (\ac{STOI}) by small margins while decreasing speech quality (\ac{PESQ}), also by small margins. A simple perceptually-weighted loss function has been presented which does not improve results, but could be used as a foundation for further work.
