\small{
Two neural architectures are developed for single-channel speech dereverberation: one end-to-end network, one frequency domain network.
Both models are trained on the same data
Losses, as well as \ac{STOI} and \ac{PESQ} measures are calculated
Directions for future improvements are considered.
